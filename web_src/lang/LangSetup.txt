In order to create a new language you will need to add a folder with the language's name first

Then copy and translate the lang file from any other language

How to translate files
    "add_button" => "Add",
    would become
    "add_button" => "New Translation Here",

then in the /includes/sidebar.php
look for the <!--Languages--> Header

    Add a new line like this under the others \/

   < a href="#" onclick="switchLanguage('folderNameHere')"></i>YOUR TEXT LABEL HERE</a>
